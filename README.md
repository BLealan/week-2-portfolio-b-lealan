#Personal Profile

##Description

In order to showcase personal work, skills and indeed development, having an online portfolio is a vital asset for employers. As such, we were tasked with creating our own personal portfolio, coding the HTML and CSS from scratch. With the structural elements and content featured in the HTML, the real challenge for me was in CSS and wrestling with the layout of the page!
